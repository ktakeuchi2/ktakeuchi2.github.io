## Hello, I am Kiki Takeuchi!

</right>

I am currently an Environmental Science B.S. Undergraduate at UC Santa Barbara. My interests lie in marine ecology, food security, and GIS applications to conservation issues. I recently conducted research abroad as a student in Thailand and Indonesia, studying the coral reefs and marine ecosystems in these regions. Outside of school, I am a barista for Philz Coffee, and enjoy playing the uke, thrifting, and going for long hikes. fa("rocket")

Some of my goals include backpacking Vietnam and Japan, opening up a sustainable cafe, and surfing around the world. Another goal is to apply GIS skills to spacially mapping how coffee-growing regions are projected to respond to climate changes.
