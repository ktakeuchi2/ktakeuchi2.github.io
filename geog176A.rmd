In Summer Session B of 2020, I took an introductory GIS course, Geog 172A. This class was based in the coding language, R. This is a list of the projects I have been working on.

#### [Building a project website](https://github.com/ktakeuchi2/ktakeuchi2.github.io)

- This was Lab01, in which we created a website using Github Pages, where all of our work would be featured for this class.
- Through this project, we explored the uses of R Markdown, Viewer, and the 'knit' function to see our changes throughout the process.
- Includes a github repo for access to all the code.
